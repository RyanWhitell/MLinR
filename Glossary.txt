Categorical Data: Features that are factors in R. Discrete features.

Class: Output variable that is predicted.

Data set: Collection of examples.

Example: One row of the data set. Contains features and possibly a label.

Feature Columns: Input variable used in making predictions.

Hyperparameter: The "knobs" that you tweak during successive runs of training a model. For example, learning rate is a hyperparameter.

Label | Target: The class column in an example.

Model: The representation of what an ML system has learned from the training data.

Parameter: A variable of a model that the ML system trains on its own. For example, weights are parameters whose values the ML system gradually learns through successive training iterations.

Prediction: A model's output when provided with an input example.

Test Set: The subset of the data set that you use to test your model after the model has gone through initial vetting by the validation set.

Training Set: The subset of the data set used to train a model.

Validation Set: A subset of the data set—disjunct from the training set—that you use to adjust hyperparameters.
